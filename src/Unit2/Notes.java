    /*
a class in programming defines a new abstract data type. A class is the formal
implementation, or blueprint, of the attributes and behaviors of an object.
- When you create objects or instances of a class in coding, you create new variables or
objects of that class data type.
Eg: Scanner scanner = new scanner, Scanner is either a file or blueprint, scanner is an object
class: a program entity that represents a template for a new type of objects.
object or instance: An entity that combines attributes(data) and behavior(methods).
    -object-oriented programming(OOP):Programs that perform their behavior as interactions
between objects. Java is object-oriented.
EG: The car class is a template for creating Car objects.
